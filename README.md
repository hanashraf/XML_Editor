# XML_Editor
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse such files and do some basic operations. In this project, we worked on developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file.
</br>
The user can </br>
● specify the location of an input XML file.</br>
● check the XML consistency(the input XML may have inconsistencies like missing any of the closing and opening tags or not matching tags).</br>
The program should be able to</br>
● detect and visually show any errors in consistency.</br>
● solve the errors.</br>
●pretify and minify.</br>
●convert from XML to JASON.</br>
●compress and decompress.</br>
●draw the graph.</br>
